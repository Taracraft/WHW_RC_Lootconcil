Inspiration gave me the addon:

The tables for the votes are modified and displayed as a table column depending on the settings of the radio buttons at lootdropp.
I developed this to always be able to understand who got what in the raid and you don't have to look at the history all the time.
For example, if you get an item for BIS, this addon counts this assignment and posts it in the loot window permanently for the length of time you log in.
I can also adapt this to other guilds if needed.
Savevariabels and Config menu is planned.
